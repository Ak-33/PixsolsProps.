This is a lightsaber that I am working on. 
(Mostly saving up for). It will be a split saber similar to Cal Kestisâ€™ saber. 
I will accomplish the split saber ability  by using a product that ultra sabers sells, which you can see an image of below. 
As well as a model of the saber and schematics. <br><br>

In length the sabers will be symmetrical but not in design. 
There will be two sides to the saber: a light and a dark side. 
The light side of the saber will have white highlights, will sport a brown leather grip and produce an unstable Purple blade.
 While the dark side of the saber will have gold highlights, 
 sport a black leather grip, spikes around the blade emitter and produce a clean red blade. <br><br>
 
 The story I have put behind this build is that the user of these lightsabers is an ex Jedi who became angry with the Jedi order sometime before the clone wars. 
 This was because the council had become too involved in politics during the time instead of helping ones in need.
 With their lust for change consuming them it led this Jedi down a dark path. Leading them to discovering the dark side and all the powers it promises.
 After being seduced to the dark side by a sith the ex Jedi attempted to bleed their purple kyber crystal. 
 However, because of the good that still remained in this force user they were unable to put enough hate into the crystal, 
 cracking the crystal instead. Realizing their mistake they killed the sith that seduced them taking their saber for their own. 
 While the ex Jedi never returned to the Jedi order they also did not fully commit themselves to the dark side. 
 This force user now travels the galaxy helping ones in need using all the powers that the force provides.

  In order to get started in making props for cosplay, a few things are necessary in my opinion.
  Those are a hobby knife, foam, glue, and paint. <br><br>

  Hobby knife: Any will do as long as it is sharp and has replaceable blades.
  In a pinch, a box cutter can work; sometimes using a box cutter is easier if you’re doing larger cuts.
  However, you may run into some trouble while trying to cut smaller pieces out.  <br><br>

  Foam: EVA floor mat foam is what you want for larger props and cosplay.
  Use hobby/cosplay foam for smaller/thinner pieces. EVA foam can be found cheapest on Amazon,
  about $20 for a four-pack, and cosplay foam can be found at Hobby Lobby and other craft stores.<br><br>

  Glue: I’d recommend getting DAP Contact Cement for gluing large items together.
  DAP is flexible after it dries, which makes it great for foam.
  Hot glue and super glue will also work for large pieces, but both have downsides.
  Hot glue can melt the foam and won't stick very well when gluing large pieces,
  and super glue will become rigid after drying, which is not great for a flexible material. <br><br>

  Paint: Foam is an absorbent material, similar to a sponge; therefore, it is a must (in most cases) to prime the foam before painting.
  Personally, I use the spray-on Plasti Dip. I’ve seen other people use the liquid Flex Seal, and it works well for them.
  After priming, you can then use most any spray paint. Spray paint will crack over time, so if you’re painting armor or
  an item that will be moved and handled a lot, I'd recommend Plaid FX paint. (If you use this paint, you don’t have to prime
  because it is specifically made for foam.)  <br><br>

  Other optional tools (All of these tools are optional. While they do make some things easier, you can make awesome-looking pieces with just the essentials):<br>
  Respirator - if you’re working in an enclosed area with DAP Contact Cement or spray paint, this is a must,
  Knife sharpener - Foam dulls knives very quickly; if you want to get clean cuts, I’d recommend sharpening your knife every 3-4 cuts,
  Self-healing cutting mat, Alex Fast Dry - this is great to cover up mistakes or imperfections in the foam, Dremel, and a belt sander.

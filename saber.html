This is the first prop I ever made. I made around the age of 14. 
It was a really fun time working on it especially since both my father and grandfather helped me on it. 
The main hilt is a PVC pipe painted silver.  
The grips are also made of PVC. The large box at the top is made of a block of wood painted black and gold. 
There is also an exposed  “kyber crystal” which is some gem I had gotten at one of those shifting places years before. 
The blade is constructed with a polycarbonate tube with rolls of diffusion material inside. <br><br>

When I made this lightsaber the story I put to it was the Jedi who originally owned it had been killed and this was handed down to their padawan. 
This explains why the saber is so dirty and worn. 
The Kyber crystal has also been damaged which is why there is a wire going from the exposed crystal to the “power regulator” (wooden box).

This is my fourth custom lightsaber. Long story short, I ended up with a steel pipe that I thought would be perfect for a lightsaber. Other than the exposed kyber crystal, the hilt, steel pipe, and screws, everything is 3D printed.
You can see revisions of the models below. When I got the steel pipe, I knew I wanted the saber to be from the High Republic era of Star Wars. However, this saber did not start off as a crossguard; I added that detail pretty late into
this project.
<br><br>
All the 3D printed parts I modeled myself, with the exception of the knurling pattern on the clamp piece. I got the pattern off a knurled screw STL from Thingiverse. Unfortunately, I don't remember who made the model.
This is also the first prop that I airbrushed. I found a beautiful pearl white-colored paint by Createx Colors (called "Wicked Pearl White"). From reviews I've read, their paint quality is hit or miss, but it worked great for me!
Because of the all-white color scheme, a lot of imperfections and dirt tend to show up on the saber, but other than that, I am super happy with the paint job I got on these saber parts. Lastly, the crystal was purchased off of eBay,
and it looks really good. It has a great pattern inside of it that lights up great due to the LED underneath it. Internally, the saber has a Proffie V3.9 board powered by an 18650 battery. The sound font is a free one by
greyscalefonts, called Magnetic.
<br><br>
As previously stated, this saber is from the High Republic era of Star Wars. The original owner of this saber was from the same era, but not
much is known about this Jedi other than they lost their first lightsaber on a peace treaty mission that ended up going sideways. When losing the lightsaber,
they traded the saber for their life. The lightsaber was lost for hundreds of years until it was found during the reign of the Empire by a young child with "special abilities."
At least, that's what the locals called her innate tie with the Force. Because of her innate tie with the Force, the kyber crystal called out to the girl, making her aware of its location. Unfortunately,
this call was also felt by the
Grand Inquisitor and Lord Vader. Due to this simply being a call from a kyber crystal, the Inquisitors sent out their most inexperienced Inquisitor, The Eleventh Brother. Once the Eleventh Brother arrived on the planet,
 he found the girl with the lightsaber. Instead of killing her, he hatched a plan to train her in the dark side of the Force. He felt her innate power with the Force, and he wanted to control it. Maybe he could overthrow the
Grand Inquisitor and Lord Vader. He trained the girl for some time before Vader caught on and felt his betrayal. Because of this, he sent the Eleventh Brother on a special mission, to face a very powerful Jedi. The Eleventh Brother
never returned to his apprentice, and no one knows what the girl will do with her new lessons on the dark side of the Force.

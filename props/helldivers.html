This is a 3D printed Helldivers helmet. The model I used was a free one by Tojik on Printables. It can be found <a class="link" href="https://www.printables.com/model/831524-helldivers-2-helmet-smooth/files" target="_blank">here</a>
In the game, Helldivers 2 the Helldivers are a super elite fighting force comprised of the best Super Earth has to offer. Helldivers fight for freedom and their way of life no matter the cost. Or maybe the game is just a tad bit satirical, but I don't want to get
in trouble for spreading false broadcasts...
<br><br>
The main uniforms the Helldivers wear are black and yellow with silver highlights. This is the color scheme I went with for my helmet. Helldivers are known to take lots of damage during their missions, so I wanted to make sure that was
reflected in my prop. Originally, I was going to make a pristine Helldivers helmet, but the helmet came off the printer a little too small for my head, so I decided to battle-damage it. The helmet is printed in 6 pieces that I then glued together.
After everything was printed, I then sanded the helmet starting at 120 grit and working my way up to 220. I then sprayed it with automotive filler primer and went back to sanding. I did that 3 times in total. Once I was happy with how smooth
the print was, I mixed up a cup of UV resin and baby powder to get the helmet even smoother. I applied the mixture in thin coats and made a makeshift UV curing chamber (seen in photos below) to cure the resin. Once the resin was cured, I hit it
with a quick 800 grit sanding and then I painted it. First, I started with a silver base coat. I applied petroleum jelly on the areas I wanted bits of scratches of paint to be. After that, I applied a black coat, wiping off the petroleum jelly to reveal the silver
underneath. Finally, I masked everything off and painted the fin yellow.
